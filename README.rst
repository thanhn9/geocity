Geocity Module Repository
=========================

This simple project is an example to show proxmity on the cities given its geo latitude and longitude location.  And also do keyword querying on the cities.

Approach:
---------------
Used Flask for web routes as to create Rest API for this project.  Geo-city info was parsed and set to a user-defined class type representation.  Stored info in a dictionary for indexing.  This can carry over to big data with data warehousing techniques and cached using popular tools such as Whoosh, Apache-Lucene, solr, etc., but it's not in the scope here.  

It's possible to improve the speed on the proximity search.  Will bring in indexing library to accomplish this by caching, and not compute it during run-time.  Will use Python Whoosh lib.

Vincenty is used as a choice of distance function as it claimed to have more accuracy as it's model based on an ellipsoid shape, implemented as part of the Python geopy package.
Method use of lexical search is simply a regular expression search using the re.findall function against the city name fields.
Method use for proximity search currently is linearly computed during runtime.

Steps:
--------
1. git clone https://github.com/thanhn9/geocity.git
2. cd geocity
3. make start (which will install the packages and start-up the service)


Please refer to document "apidoc.docx" for API info.  The file "apidoc.rst" was generated using a utility tool called 'pandoc' -- https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html, i.e. 
$ pandoc -f docx apidoc.docx -t rst -o apidoc.rst
                         
Client tests:
-------------
For a UI to the Rest API calls, I think Postman did a good job.  Can refer to https://www.getpostman.com/.  At times, I used Python requests module and/or a browser will do, as these activities are mainly referred to the HTTP GET method.

Deployment
---------------
Open firewall to access github.com to access the above geocity.git repository.
For the instance/VM that needs to host these API functions, follow the above steps to deploy, using Chef/Ansible or scripting or which already has access to that instance/VM for configuration management.  May even setup a Jenkins job to ssh to the specified boxes for deployment.

Others TODO:
-------
Turn the app into a service with init.d/<geocity> script, so it can be call like so:
service geocity stop
service geocity start
etc.

Added caching, indexing to file systems (Data warehouse)
